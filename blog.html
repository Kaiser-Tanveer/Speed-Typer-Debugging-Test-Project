          <h2>1. Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage:</h2>
          <div class="full">

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>localStorage</strong>
                  persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the
                  domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and
                  reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.

                  <strong>sessionStorage</strong>
                  is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as
                  long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you
                  open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and
                  new storage.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is
                  declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists
                  in the <strong>global scope</strong>. The global variables can
                  be accessed by any line of code in the program, including
                  inside blocks.

                  statements, for statements, and the like. You can also use
                  them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not
                  to be confused with empty object literals.

          <h2>3. Way through the JavaScript Event Loop works:</h2>
          <div class="full">
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <strong>event loop</strong> is a process that waits for the
                Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
                Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If
                there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the
                Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type
                undefined.
              </li>
              <li>
                A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable
                that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.
